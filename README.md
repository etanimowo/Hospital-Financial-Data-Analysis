## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital financial data, focusing on billing, insurance claims, operational expenses, and revenue trends. The goal is to extract key performance insights (KPIs) that help assess hospital financial health and efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights
â€¢	Developed a structured dataset with 1,000 records covering billing, claims, and expenses.
â€¢	Calculated 7+ KPIs, including Claim Approval Rate, Profit Margin, and Expense-to-Revenue Ratio.
â€¢	Performed data analysis using Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts).
â€¢	Identified financial bottlenecks such as high claim rejection rates affecting revenue.
â€¢	Created an interactive Excel dashboard for hospital financial monitoring.

## ðŸ“Š Impact & Insights
